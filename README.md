#### Characteristics
* :construction: Level-2A (L2A) products, avaiable from ESA's Copernicus Open Access Hub ([SciHub DHuS](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus)) since begin of May 2017, will be respected _soon_ (please stay tuned here).  
  The _Download_ tool will then display a L2A product by a Group Layer (incl. embodied scene classification image, SCL, with suitable symbology).
* Proxy server settings are automatically taken into account by the python interpreter, either based on respective Internet Explorer settings, or based on the two environment variables `https_proxy` + `http_proxy` (incl. optional Basic Authorization, see the proxy-example*.* files within the [doc](doc) directory).
* CODE-DE support (since March 2017): The [German mirror site provides DHuS](https://code-de.org/dhus) similary to SciHub. The Toolbox tools do now allow for choosing CODE-DE as an alternative DHuS site (in addition to the mainstream DHuS at SciHub site).  
  ðŸ““ **Note**: It may happen that certain data sets are missing at CODE-DE site. If in doubt, rerun the respective tool against the reference DHuS at SciHub site.
* The newer version (>=14) of the Products Specification Document (PSD) is respected, but ArcMap does not yet support it in terms of a built-in raster product (:construction: presumably upcoming ArcGIS 10.5.1 will support it, so please stay tuned here). As a substitute for this, the natural color composite (TCI) is used for the _Download_ tool output parameter until further notice.
* A multi-tile package is represented by multiple records in the search results table (raster catalog) rather than by one single product record. This way each tile preview can be examined individually. When it comes to downloading such a multi-tile product, the _Download_ tool treats those multiple records as a single entity, i.e. a single (full) product download will be performed regardless of how many tiles are _Marked_.  
   Over time, this kind of quirk loses its relevance because newer products (those provided since the end of September 2016) are provided solely as single-tile packages.
* Contrary to the previous point: When using the "Image selection" mode of the _Download_ tool, the download of product images is performed with _Marked_ tiles only, i.e. non-marked tiles are actually ignored even if they are part of a multi-tile package.

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)


```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
